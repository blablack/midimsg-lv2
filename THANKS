Thanks
======

I would like to thanks all the work from all the contributors on
AlsaModularSynth, especially:

 * Matthias Nagorni <mana@suse.de>
 * Fons Adriaensen <adriaena@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Karsten Wiese <fzu@users.sourceforge.net>
 * Malte Steiner <steiner@block4.com>
 * Guido Scholz <guido.scholz@bayernline.de>

Without their work on AMS, these plugins wouldn't have existed.

A great thanks as well to the authors of LV2, especially:

 * David Robillard <d@drobilla.net>

who guided me in this work.

A great thanks to Florent Berthaut <florent@hitmuri.net> for Tranches:

A great thanks to Harry van Haaren <harryhaaren@gmail.com> for Luppp as 
I copied a great deal of his GUI creations:

my questions on the Linux Audio Developers mailing list:
